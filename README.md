# vim-config
This is my personal vim configuration.
It is largely based on Doug Black's http://dougblack.io/words/a-good-vimrc.html
It also uses Ag-vim: https://github.com/rking/ag.vim, that requires Ag.

### Notes
For now, it's only my .vimrc here, without notes on installing plugins. More on that will follow.
